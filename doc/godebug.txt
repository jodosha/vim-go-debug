INTRODUCTION                                    *godebug*

Allows calling Delve, a debugger for the go language, directly from neovim.
Vim is not yet supported.

For installation instructions on Delve, see the gitub page here:

COMMANDS                                        *godebug-commands*

All commands start a new internal terminal window using the |:term| command.
If you have never used |:term| before, you'll find it's windows are controlled
differently than normal windows. You might want to read up on the differences,
but for quick reference: exiting is just like any normal terminal with 'exit',
and for switch windows |CTRL-\_CTRL-N| is probably what you need.

                                                *godebug-:GoToggleBreakpoint*
:GoToggleBreakpoint     Sets or removes a breakpoint at the current active
                        line.

                                                *godebug-:GoDebug*
:GoDebug                Starts the debugger

                                                *godebug-:GoDebugTest*
