    * On macOS, it is advised to install through [brew](https://github.com/derekparker/delve/blob/master/Documentation/installation/osx/install.md#via-homebrew), due to problems with certificates.

## Development and Improvements

This is a tool that is useful for **my workflow**.
If you think it's useful, be my guest and use it too.

I won't actively support this plugin. If you find a bug, or want an improvement, please open a PR if you want to see it fixed.

## Troubleshooting

### Error detected while processing function godebug#debug
**vim** is not yet supported. Try it with **neovim**.
